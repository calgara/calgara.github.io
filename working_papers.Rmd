  *Abstract:*	Are Senators cross-pressured by party influence and constituent demands on procedural votes? We present a theory positing that Senators are indeed cross-pressured between these two demands and that they anticipate an electoral cost for their procedural voting record. In an analysis of Senate procedural votes since the 92nd Congress, we find that procedural votes are salient to voters and important to party leaders. Using a new spatial measure of obstruction preference, we demonstrate our finding three ways. First, obstruction preferences have become more polarized as the Senate experiences more intense legislative obstruction. Second, electorally vulnerable members are most likely to break from their party on procedural votes. Third, we find that voters electorally reward majority party Senators that break from their party and behave like minority party obstructionists. Our findings suggest that, unlike the House, Senate procedural votes are largely indistinguishable from substantive votes and are electorally salient.

          *Abstract:* Recent work finds that a decline in the incumbency advantage coincides with the rise of partisanship as a determinant of congressional electoral outcomes. While this work updates our view of congressional elections, it is unclear if this holds in the more candidate-centered and high-information electoral context of the U.S. Senate. In this paper, I address these two considerations by evaluating a theory positing that polarization conditions the influence of incumbency and partisanship as Senate election determinants. Using data on the entire direct-election Senate era and survey data, this paper finds that: (1) polarization provides a partisan advantage for candidates running in states in which they are members of the partisan majority and (2) polarization positively conditions the incumbency advantage for Senators representing states that favor the other party. These findings suggest that Senators may still successfully cultivate a personal brand in the face of growing ideological differences between the parties.

          *Abstract:* While the use of racial appeals by the 2016 Trump campaign is indisputable, researchers are actively debating their precise role in influencing voter behavior in the election. We seek to expand upon existing research which finds that racial animus electorally benefited the Trump campaign. We examine to what extent those benefits redounded to GOP candidates down-ballot and whether racial animus distorted ideological proximity voting in the 2016 election. We find that racial animus among voters helped Republicans at multiple ballot levels and that higher levels of racial animus distorted correct proximity voting among voters ideologically closest to the Democratic candidate. Our findings suggest that high salience campaign appeals on race at the presidential level can influence elections for the House and Senate. We also provide evidence that the process of racial partisan realignment is incomplete, as some white voters still vote incongruously with their ideology due to racial animus.

          *Abstract:* The classical "Textbook Theory" of Congress posits that legislators are relatively autonomous actors who work together on a bipartisan basis to maximize their probability of re-election (Shepsle 1989). This classical district-centered theory of Congress posits that legislators are motivated to engage in bipartisan legislative behavior and work together by the geographical similarity of their respective districts. Congressional scholars have largely cast doubt on the importance of district-centered considerations to inform the behavior of legislators, shifting the focus to partisan-centered preferences (Rohde 1991, Cox & McCubbins 1993, 2005). Moreover, while scholars have debated these theories, they have said relatively little about the salience of these theories across varying policy issues. Using the distinct expression of legislative behavior provide by bill co-sponsorship and geographic proximity methods we explore the extent to which district similarity influences how legislators work together in the Congressional network across varying degrees of partisan polarization. Treating Congress as a series of distinct policy networks and using exponential random graph models (ERGM), we evaluate a theory arguing that geographic proximity is a salient predictor of legislator cooperation in district-centered policy domains (i.e. agriculture, land management), even during the hyper-partisan contemporary Congress.

<center> **The Influence of Incumbency, Partisanship, Candidate Quality \& National Tides in U.S. Senate Elections, 1914-2016** </center><br/>
<center> ***$\star$Working Manuscript in Preparation $\star$[Working Manuscript Draft](August2017_Nationalization_Senate_Elections_Algara.pdf) $\star$[Manuscript Data Materials](mailto:calgara@ucdavis.edu)*** </center><br/>
          *Abstract:* Relative to elections for the U.S. House, little is known about what influences outcomes for the U.S. Senate. While standing models of congressional election outcomes have been applied to the Senate, many of these models fail to account for salient variables, such as candidate quality, or focus their analysis on elections during the candidate-centered era. In this paper, I specify a comprehensive model of Senate election outcomes which focuses on four salient predictors of electoral outcomes: national partisan tides, incumbency, state partisanship, and candidate quality. I then evaluate this model using a novel dataset containing every Senate race since the adoption of the 17th amendment in 1913. Congruent with recent findings in the U.S. House, the model finds evidence that Senate elections are becoming more partisan-centered at the expense of a candidate quality advantage. On the other hand, and contrary to recent studies, the model finds evidence of an incumbency advantage increase in contemporary Senate elections. However, this increase in the incumbency advantage corresponds to a decline in the pivotal role of incumbency in determining Senate election outcomes during a more partisan-centered period of elections. I conclude by showing that Senate elections are becoming more nationalized and president-centered contests.

<center> **Legislative Signaling or Random Error? An Analysis of Spatially Incorrect Voting in Congress** </center>

          *Abstract:* Theoretical and empirical models of congressional voting assumes that legislators vote with the sole purpose to move policy closer to their ideologically ideal point, with the most prominent being the NOMINATE model. While NOMINATE correctly classifies the vast majority of votes cast by members of Congress, a significant number of votes are misclassified and coded as spatial error. The literature on congressional voting assumes this error to be random and idiosyncratic across members. We dispute this conventional notion and argue that spatial error in congressional is not random, but rather systematic across members. We present a theory positing that spatial error is more likely on roll-call votes tackling salient policy issues and among members representing districts with greater ideological divergence between the median voter and the member's primary election constituency. Using Aldrich-McKelvey scaling to place legislators and constituencies in the same ideological common space, we find support for our theory. We attribute this finding to the greater electoral uncertainty faced by ideological moderates and members representing districts with greater ideological divergence between key constituencies. Our findings have implications for the NOMINATE model, the nature of spatial error in legislative voting, and the electoral cross-pressures faced by legislators.

<center> **The U.S. Congress and the Israeli Lobby: An Analysis of the Determinants of Congressional Support for Iranian Sanctions** </center>

      *Abstract:* Since the late 1960's the US has maintained a relationship with Israel that is largely unprecedented in the history of US foreign policy. The United States Senate plays a role in maintaining this relationship and plays an essential constitutional role in foreign policymaking generally. Previous work on the determinants of congressional support of foreign policy initiatives focuses on the electoral connection, emphasizing a role for constituent-based variables when determining a Senator’s foreign policy votes. However this limited scholarship fails to account for a legislator's perception of the national interest and how this influences their foreign policy positions. Additionally, Mearsheimer and Walt (2007) note that the "Israel Lobby" sways US foreign policy but the extent of this influence on congress is unclear. Using the salient case of U.S. sanctions against Iran, this paper explores the role of constituent-level and elite level variables in determining an individual Senator's acquiescence to the ``pro-Israel'' position. These findings have implications for causes of the continued strength of the US-Israel relationship as well as implications for the determinants of congressional foreign policy positions more broadly.
