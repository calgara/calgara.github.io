<br/> <em>Abstract:</em> Theories of collective accountability in
American elections center on the ability, and willingness, of voters to
hold legislators accountable for the job performance of the president
and his party in Congress. While this work finds that legislators pay an
electoral penalty for low institutional approval ratings under their
party’s control, little is known whether this form of collective
accountability translates to the state legislative context. We argue
that collective accountability in state legislative elections follows a
two-tiered approach, with state legislators being held accountable for
national and state policymaking institutions. Using new state-level
measures of institutional approval for national and state institutions,
along with voter-level data from the 2007-2020 Cooperative Election
Study, we find that presidential approval is the principal growing
motivator of state legislative partisan choice with other policymaking
institutions playing a minimal role, at best. These findings suggest
that the electoral fortune of state legislative candidates, and state
parties, are largely and increasingly determined by national forces
outside of the purview of state-level policymaking institutions.<br />

<br/> <em>Abstract:</em> The increase in elite-level polarization and
changing partisan nature of elections to the U.S. House led scholars to
posit that candidate characteristics are minor considerations in
determining these election outcomes. However, it is not clear if these
trends extend to the U.S. Senate or if candidate considerations have
lost the relatively minor predictive power they exhibited during the
2010s, particularly as partisanship continued to rise as a predictor of
election outcomes. Using historical data on elections to the U.S. House
and Senate from 1900 to the recent 2022 midterm elections, we test
whether the incumbency advantage and candidate quality differentials are
still salient predictors of congressional elections. We find that the
incumbency advantage largely disappeared as a salient component of
election outcomes for both chambers as partisanship increasingly shapes
these outcomes. By contrast, we find that candidate quality
differentials, while waning, still can play a considerable role in
shaping congressional election outcomes, particularly in the Senate. We
conclude by showing that the declining emergence of quality candidates
may have played a pivotal role during the 2022 election cycle by costing
Republicans control of the U.S. Senate.<br />

<br/> <em>Abstract:</em> While the literature largely agrees that
candidates are electorally punished for political scandals, it is
unclear whether citizens differentiate between varying types of
scandals, limiting our collective understanding of whether certain types
of scandals are more salient in the eyes of citizens. To overcome this
gap, we argue that citizens not only differentiate between types of
scandals, but they also perceive sexual harassment to be a far worse
scandal than other types of scandals, such as plagiarism and corruption.
Using a conjoint experiment to simultaneously estimate the effect of
differing scandals on candidate evaluations in the United Kingdom, we
find strong evidence that involvement in sexual harassment scandals
lowers candidate support to a greater degree than other types of
scandals and is conditional while voters and candidates are both male.
These results suggest that citizens do strategically punish candidates
for the substance of their scandals rather than the mere presence of
scandal.<br />

<br/> <em>Abstract:</em> Members and congressional parties go to great
lengths to signal bipartisanship to voters, believing they will be
electorally rewarded for cooperating with the other party. However, the
House majority party also has an incentive to enact its preferred,
party-oriented policy program and obtaining minority party support
requires legislative compromise. We theorize that electorally strong
majority parties are relatively unconcerned about their public support,
and are thus more willing to pass partisan bills. When the majority
party’s public support is tenuous, it moderates bills to receive
minority support and reap electoral benefits from bipartisanship. Using
time-series data of public opinion polling and measures of
bipartisanship in Congress, we find support for this claim. We also find
that salient bills increase the strength of the relationship between
majority party electoral standing and bill extremity. Finally, our
results demonstrate the extent to which the majority party is
electorally risk averse; proximity to an election does not change the
relationship between electoral standing and bipartisanship on passage.
Our results speak to the ability of the majority party to set the level
of bipartisanship within the House and the inherent trade-off between
dramatic policy change and public support.<br />

is considerable research on the role racial attitudes play in shaping
white political preferences, relatively little is known about how racial
attitudes influence white participation in democratic politics. We
present a model examining the relationship between racial attitudes and
political participation in the 2016, 2018, and 2020 U.S. national
elections. Using a variety of measures of political participation, our
analysis presents a clear finding: the direction of the relationship
between latent conservative racial attitudes and political participation
is asymmetrical among partisan sub-groups, with conservative racial
attitudes motivating participation among white Republicans and, to a
greater degree, depressing participation among white Democrats. This
finding has stark implications for how racialized appeals are likely to
be deployed in an era of increasing affective partisan
polarization.<br />

<br/> <em>Abstract:</em> Context: As COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out
in early 2011, governments at all levels in the US faced significant
difficulty in consistently and efficiently administering injections in
the face of vaccination resistance among a public increasingly political
polarized on vaccination preferences prior to the beginning of the mass
vaccinations. Methods: Using an original conjoint experiment fielded to
a nationally representative sample prior to the mass proliferation of
COVID-19 vaccines, we examine how different incentives (e.g., employer
mandates, state-organized or health care provider–organized vaccination
clinics, or financial incentives) affect the public’s preference to get
vaccinated. We also test how financial incentive preferences correlate
with self-reported vaccination intention using observational data from
the Kaiser Family Foundation June 2021 Health Tracking Poll. Findings:
We find financial incentives positively influence vaccine preferences
among the mass public and all partisan groups, including Republicans
initially “unlikely” to be vaccinated. Using the observational data, we
replicate our experimental findings showing positive financial incentive
attitudes positively correlate with self-reported vaccination
disclosures.Conclusions: Our results provide support for direct
financial incentives, rather than other incentives, as being a valuable
tool for policymakers tasked with alleviating vaccination resistance
among a US mass public increasingly polarized along partisan
lines.<br />

literature studies the relationship between ideological and affective
polarization. By taking a Downsian approach to affective polarization we
contribute to this literature and demonstrating that affective
polarization is driven by congruence between citizens and their party,
relative to other parties, in the general liberal-conservative space and
across a host of salient issue domains. We find robust support for our
theory using individual-level national election survey data from the
United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Finland. Moreover, we find
that ideological differences inform affective polarization independently
from partisan identifications and that they drive more out-party
animosity than in-party affinity. These findings have implications
towards a more unified understanding of the citizen determinants of
affective polarization and the role ideology plays in shaping the views
held by partisans across democracies.<br />

<br/> <em>Abstract:</em> From the onset of the first confirmed case of
COVID-19 in January 2020 to Election Day in November, the United States
experienced over 9,400,000 cases and 232,000 deaths. This crisis largely
defined the campaign between former Vice President Joe Biden and
President Donald Trump, centering on the Trump administration’s efforts
in mitigating the number of cases and deaths. While conventional wisdom
suggested that Trump and his party would lose support due to the
severity of COVID-19 across the country, such an effect is hotly debated
empirically and theoretically. In this research, we evaluate the extent
to which the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic influenced support for
President Trump in the 2020 election. Across differing modeling
strategies and a variety of data sources, we find evidence that
President Trump gained support in counties with higher COVID-19 deaths.
We provide an explanation for this finding by showing that voters
concerned about the economic impacts of pandemic-related restrictions on
activity were more likely to support Trump and that local COVID-19
severity was predictive of these economic concerns. While COVID-19
likely contributed to Trump’s loss in 2020, our analysis demonstrates
that he gained support among voters in localities worst affected by the
pandemic.<br />

Materials</a></em></strong> <br/> <br/> <em>Abstract:</em> Vaccines are
the most effective means at combating sickness and death caused by
COVID-19. Yet, there are significant populations within the United
States who are vaccine-hesitant, some due to ideological or
pseudo-scientific motivations, others due to significant perceived and
real costs from vaccination. Given this vaccine hesitancy, twenty state
governors from May 12th to July 21st 2021 implemented some form of
vaccination lottery aiming to increase low vaccination rates. In the
aftermath of these programs, however, the critical question of whether
these lotteries had a direct effect on vaccination remains. Previous
literature on financial incentives for public health behaviors is
consistent: Financial incentives significantly increase incentivized
behaviors. Yet, work done specifically on state vaccine lotteries is
both limited in scope and mixed in its conclusions. To help fill this
gap in the literature, we use synthetic control methods to analyze all
20 states and causally identify, for eighteen states, the effects of
their lotteries on both first-dose and complete vaccination rates.
Within those eighteen states, we find strong evidence that all but three
states’ lotteries had positive effects on first-dose vaccination. We
find for complete vaccinations, however, over half the states analyzed
had negative or null effects. We explore possibilities related to these
mixed results including the states’ overall partisanship, vaccine
hesitancy, and the size of their lotteries finding null effects for each
of these explanations. Therefore, we conclude that the design of these
programs is likely to blame: Every state lottery only incentivized
first-doses with no additional or contingent incentive based on a second
dose. Our findings suggest that the design of financial incentives is
critical to their success, or failure, but generally, these programs can
induce an uptake in vaccination across diverse demographic, ideological,
and geographic contexts in the United States.<br />

Materials</a></em></strong> <br/> <br/> <em>Abstract:</em> Fenno (1975)
famously posited that the mass public’s assessments of the U.S. Congress
are rooted in a paradox, with citizens holding negative evaluations of
the collective Congress while holding favorable views of their
individual members of Congress. Since the conceptualization of Fenno’s
Paradox, the Congress underwent pronounced changes due to increased
ideological polarization between increasingly homogeneous parties
comprised of more partisan loyal, ideologically extreme, legislators. In
this paper, we ask whether this partisan polarization shifted the
public’s assessments of the Congress and their individual
representatives over time. Leveraging over 45 years of new data
measuring the monthly approval of Congress and legislators with a fully
specified model, we find that greater polarization lowers the approval
rating of both over time, suggesting that greater polarization weakens
Fenno’s Paradox by considerably lowering legislator approval. We explore
the underlying mechanism of this finding at the individual-level,
finding that co-partisan support for Congress and opposing-partisan
support for legislators collapses since 1980. Taken together, our
results suggest that partisan polarization plays a large role in
motivating the historic decline in congressional approval and the
ability of legislators to amass a personal incumbency advantage.<br />

on American presidential elections posits that voters engage in
anticipatory balancing. Anticipatory balancing predicts voters who
prefer divided government will split their ticket in order to moderate
collective policy outcomes by forcing agreement among institutions
controlled by opposing parties. We test this theory within the case of
the 2021 Georgia U.S. Senate runoffs, which solely determined whether
Democrats would have unified control of the federal government by
determining majority control of the Senate given preceding November
victories by President-elect Biden and House Democrats. Leveraging an
original survey of Georgia voters, we find no evidence of balancing
within the general electorate and among partisans across differing model
specifications. We confirm this lack of balancing in qualitative content
analysis of voter electoral runoff intentions. We reconcile this lack of
evidence for balancing to original analysis showing the unprecedented
partisan nature of contemporary Senate elections since direct-election
began in 1914.<br />

<br/> <em>Abstract:</em> The dramatic Democratic victories in the 2021
Georgia U.S. Senate runoffs handed Democrats their first majority since
2015 and, with this, unified Democratic control of Washington for the
first time since 2011. While Democratic Leaders and President Joe Biden
crafted their agenda, any hope of policy passage rested on complete
unity in a 50-50 Senate and a narrow majority in the U.S. House. Against
this backdrop, the 117<span class="math inline">\(^\text{th}\)</span>
Senate is the most polarized since direct-election began in 1914 and, by
popular accounts, the least deliberative in a generation. In this
article, we examine the implications of partisan polarization for
policymaking in the U.S. Senate throughout the direct-election era.
First, we show that greater polarization coincides with more partisan
Senate election outcomes, congruent with recent trends in the House.
Today, over 90% of Senators represent states carried by their party’s
presidential nominee. Secondly, we show that polarization coincides with
higher levels of observable obstruction, conflict, partisan unity, and
narrower majorities. Lastly, we show that this polarization coincides
with lower levels of deliberation in the form of consideration of floor
amendments and committee meetings. Taken together, we paint a picture of
a polarized Senate that is more partisan, more obstructionist, and less
deliberative.<br />

<br/> <em>Abstract:</em> Scholars argue that contemporary American
elections are pronounced in their degree of partisanship and
nationalization. While much of this work largely uncovers a heightened
degree of nationalization in contemporary elections, little is known
about how far back these patterns generalize. Given the limited
availability of American electoral data, this work also generally
focuses on a single office or during a certain segment of the post-war
period since 1946. Moreover, this work largely focuses on states as
salient units of analysis, masking potential variation found in U.S.
counties, the smallest geographical unit constituting panel observations
over time and across elections. In this note, we leverage a novel
dataset of county-level election returns for President, U.S. Senate, and
Governor, to specify a model assessing whether American elections are
more nationalized and partisan than during any other period since the
Civil War. We find evidence that presidential and Senate elections are
more partisan today than any period since the Civil War, while
gubernatorial elections are as partisan today as they were during the
late 1800s. Our findings have implications for contemporary-based
theories explaining the rise of partisanship in American elections and
demonstrates the utility of county-level data in assessing electoral
changes in America.<br />

<br/> <em>Abstract:</em> Pundits and academics across disciplines note
that the human toll brought forth by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)
pandemic in the United States (U.S.) is fundamentally unequal for
communities of color. Standing literature on public health posits that
one of the chief predictors of racial disparity in health outcomes is a
lack of institutional trust among minority communities. Furthermore, in
our own county-level analysis from the U.S., we find that counties with
higher percentages of Black and Hispanic residents have had vastly
higher cumulative deaths from COVID-19. In light of this standing
literature and our own analysis, it is critical to better understand how
to mitigate or prevent these unequal outcomes for any future pandemic or
public health emergency. Therefore, we assess the claim that raising
institutional trust, primarily scientific trust, is key to mitigating
these racial inequities. Leveraging a new, pre-pandemic measure of
scientific trust, we find that trust in science, unlike trust in
politicians or the media, significantly raises support for COVID-19
social distancing policies across racial lines. Our findings suggest
that increasing scientific trust is essential to garnering support for
public health policies that lessen the severity of the current, and
potentially a future, pandemic.<br />

<br/> <em>Abstract:</em> Do citizens weigh the ideological nature of
collective representation provided by Congress when assessing the job
performance of their national legislature? While recent aggregate-level
work suggests that congressional approval rises when Congress responds
to the ideological preferences of the mass public, individual-level
models posit that approval is a function of partisanship or valence
considerations, with little consideration for policy. I fill this
disconnect between two lines of research by presenting a model arguing
that citizens weigh the ideological representation provided by their
Congress in the face of two contrasting options of collective
ideological representation in the responsible party government era.
Using cross-sectional and panel survey data which allow for scaling
citizens and the congressional parties in the same ideological space, I
find that majority co-partisans and citizens closer in ideological
proximity to the governing majority are more likely to approve of
Congress. I also find that this the relationship between ideological
proximity and approval is independent of partisanship. These findings
have implications for the capacity of citizens to assess the collective
representation of the chief policy-making institution of their national
government.<br />

<br/> <em>Abstract:</em> The traditional view among scholars is that
voters do not weigh congressional job performance in their congressional
voting decisions. Recent work challenges this notion and provides
evidence that congressional job approval matters at the ballot box.
However, scholars are divided as to which party benefits from positive
job approval ratings. Moreover, the literature is unclear regarding the
conditions under which voters hold individual candidates accountable for
the collective performance of Congress. Analyzing individual and
aggregate level data, this study produces several key findings: (1)
assessments of congressional job performance are directly tied to the
electoral standing of the majority party; (2) positive approval ratings
raise the level of support for majority party candidates among minority
partisans and those closest to the minority in ideological proximity;
(3) majority party incumbents gain more from congressional approval than
non-incumbents and suffer less of a loss from congressional disapproval;
(4) the impact of congressional approval on majority party fortunes is
conditioned by how cohesive the majority party is. These findings
provide a clearer narrative of how collective accountability works in
congressional elections and the incentives for majority and minority
party behavior in the contemporary Congress.<br />

<br/> <em>Abstract:</em> Theoretical and empirical models of
congressional voting assumes that legislators vote with the sole purpose
to move policy closer to their ideologically ideal point, with the most
prominent being the NOMINATE model. While NOMINATE correctly classifies
the vast majority of votes cast by members of Congress, a significant
number of votes are misclassified and coded as spatial error. The
literature on congressional voting assumes this error to be random and
idiosyncratic across members. We dispute this conventional notion and
argue that spatial error in congressional is not random, but rather
systematic across members. We present a theory positing that spatial
error is more likely on roll-call votes tackling salient policy issues
and among members representing districts with greater ideological
divergence between the median voter and the member’s primary election
constituency. Using Aldrich-McKelvey scaling to place legislators and
constituencies in the same ideological common space, we find support for
our theory. We attribute this finding to the greater electoral
uncertainty faced by ideological moderates and members representing
districts with greater ideological divergence between key
constituencies. Our findings have implications for the NOMINATE model,
the nature of spatial error in legislative voting, and the electoral
cross-pressures faced by legislators. <br/> <br/>

<br/> <em>Abstract:</em> With the onset of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in
the United States, state governments and the federal administration were
forced to craft social distancing recommendations advising the general
public on how they could combat the transmission of the deadly virus.
These recommendations, and sometimes orders, advised against many daily
social activities such as visiting family members, restaurant dining,
and sporting event attendance. Adherence to and support of these
measures has been varied, with many flouting mask and group-gathering
recommendations/orders. This has reduced the effectiveness of these
measures and lead to virus resurgences across the U.S. In this research
note, we examine the role scientific knowledge and gender play in
influencing citizens’ comfort and risk perceptions regarding social
distancing recommendations and orders. In both the general population
and within parties, we find that women with high scientific knowledge
are much less comfortable breaking social distancing guidelines than
their male counterparts and women with lower scientific knowledge. These
findings shed light on how both knowledge and gender interact to drive
(non)compliance with government policies during a public health crisis
in an increasingly polarized America.<br />

</center>
<br/> <em>Abstract:</em> While scholars have found that Trump was able
to capitalize on the racial attitudes of white voters, it is less clear
how these racial attitudes influence vote-choice across partisan and
ideological cleavages in the electorate. It is also unclear whether
racial attitudes affected voting at the congressional level or electoral
outcomes at the aggregate level. Using a novel measure of racial
attitudes at the subnational level and survey data, we make three clear
findings: (1) Trump and Republican congressional candidates benefited
from racial attitudes both at the aggregate level and among white
voters, (2) this electoral benefit for Republicans persisted during the
2018 midterm elections, and (3) the effect of attitudes on vote-choice
did not significantly vary across partisan and ideological cleavages in
the white electorate. Our findings suggest that, even during the era of
highly nationalized and partisan elections, racial attitudes are still a
mechanism by which Republicans can win significant electoral support
among Democrats and relatively liberal voters in the white electorate.
These findings have implications for the growing salience of race in the
Republican electoral coalition.<br />

<br/> <em>Abstract:</em> With the onset of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in
the United States, many state and local governments were forced to
implement necessary policies to contain transmission of the deadly
virus. These policies ranged from closing most businesses to more
controversial proposals, such as postponing primary elections. In this
research note, we examine the role scientific knowledge and gender
played in citizen perceptions of these virus containment policies both
in the general population and among partisans. We find that while a
gender gap persists in scientific knowledge, both in the general
population and within the parties, women are generally more likely to
use this knowledge to inform their policy views on necessary government
action during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings shed light on how
knowledge and gender intersect to drive support for government
intervention during the time of a severe public health crisis in a
partisan America.<br />

<br/> <em>Abstract:</em> Barabási (2014) argues that a significant
proportion of nodes can be randomly removed from any scale-free network
without it breaking apart. Gao, Barzel and Barabási (2016) suggest that
three additional properties of networks, density, heterogeneity and
symmetry, facilitate their ability to adjust their activities to retain
functionality in times of stress. Barnett and Jiang (2016) examined the
World Wide Web and found that while there are changes in the use of
individual websites in this scale-free network due to weekly cycles in
viewing specific websites, extreme events as well as other social and
cultural events, the overall network is remarkably stable. This paper
suggests an additional property, the structural equivalence of nodes
that facilitates network stability. Further, it differentiates between
two forms of equivalence, synchronous or structural equivalence, and
diachronic equivalence, which indicates that two nodes’ position in a
network change over time in a similar manner. A subset of the World Wide
Web, the international news network is examined to demonstrate these
notions. Daily data on the use of the world’s 44 most frequently visited
news websites by 118 countries were mined over the 17 month period
September 1, 2015 to January 30, 2017, to create a longitudinal two-mode
network (countries and websites). The results suggest that individual
structurally and diachronic equivalent nodes may be removed from both
the international and website networks without impacting how the network
changes over time.<br />

<em>Abstract:</em> Recent work finds that a decline in the incumbency
advantage coincides with the rise of partisanship as a determinant of
congressional electoral outcomes. While this work updates our view of
congressional elections, it is unclear if this holds in the more
candidate-centered and high-information electoral context of the U.S.
Senate. In this paper, I address these two considerations by evaluating
a theory positing that polarization conditions the influence of
incumbency and partisanship as Senate election determinants. Using data
on the entire direct-election Senate era and survey data, this paper
finds that: (1) polarization provides a partisan advantage for
candidates running in states in which they are members of the partisan
majority and (2) polarization positively conditions the incumbency
advantage for Senators representing states that favor the other party.
These findings suggest that Senators may still successfully cultivate a
personal brand in the face of growing ideological differences between
the parties.<br />

<br/> <em>Abstract:</em> While the use of racial appeals by the 2016
Trump campaign is indisputable, researchers are actively debating their
precise role in influencing voter behavior in the election. We seek to
expand upon existing research which finds that racial animus electorally
benefited the Trump campaign. We examine to what extent those benefits
redounded to GOP candidates down-ballot and whether racial animus
distorted ideological proximity voting in the 2016 election. We find
that racial animus among voters helped Republicans at multiple ballot
levels and that higher levels of racial animus distorted correct
proximity voting among voters ideologically closest to the Democratic
candidate. Our findings suggest that high salience campaign appeals on
race at the presidential level can influence elections for the House and
Senate. We also provide evidence that the process of racial partisan
realignment is incomplete, as some white voters still vote incongruously
with their ideology due to racial animus.<br />

<p><br/> <em>Abstract:</em> Are Senators cross-pressured by party
influence and constituent demands on procedural votes? We present a
theory positing that Senators are indeed cross-pressured between these
two demands and that they anticipate an electoral cost for their
procedural voting record. In an analysis of Senate procedural votes
since the 92nd Congress, we find that procedural votes are salient to
voters and important to party leaders. Using a new spatial measure of
obstruction preference, we demonstrate our finding three ways. First,
obstruction preferences have become more polarized as the Senate
experiences more intense legislative obstruction. Second, electorally
vulnerable members are most likely to break from their party on
procedural votes. Third, we find that voters electorally reward majority
party Senators that break from their party and behave like minority
party obstructionists. Our findings suggest that, unlike the House,
Senate procedural votes are largely indistinguishable from substantive
votes and are electorally salient.<br />
