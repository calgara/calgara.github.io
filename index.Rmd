Thanks for visiting my website! I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from the [University of California, Davis](http://ps.ucdavis.edu/), where I was also a graduate student affiliate in the [Social & Political Interacting Networks Group](https://spins.faculty.ucdavis.edu). For the 2019 Spring semester, I also held an appointment as a Lecturer in the Political Science Department at [Sacramento State University](https://www.csus.edu/govt/) For the forthcoming academic year, I will be a part of the [American Political Science Association Congressional Fellowship Program](https://www.apsanet.org/cfp) 2019-2020 class of Congressional Fellows.        
  
My research agenda focuses broadly on the nature of ideological representation, collective accountability, voter decision rules in congressional elections, and legislative behavior. My dissertation project, chaired by Professors [Walter J. Stone](http://ps.ucdavis.edu/people/wstone) and [Erik J. Engstrom](http://ps.ucdavis.edu/people/engstrom), focuses on what determines citizen perceptions of congressional job performance and how these perceptions shape electoral outcomes and partisan legislative incentives. In addition to my dissertation, I am also involved in projects analyzing how polarization changes the nature of congressional election dynamics, how political attitudes distort proximity voting, and electoral consequences of legislative obstruction. I also have a methodological interest social network analysis and in latent variable measurement, particularly with respect to measurement of voter and elite ideological preferences in the common space and over time. For an illustration of this ideological scaling work, see the interactive map below highlighting ideological representation in the United States House of Representatives in 2018.
