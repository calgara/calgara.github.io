I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Political Science](http://ps.ucdavis.edu/) and a graduate student affiliate in the [Social & Political Interacting Networks Group](https://spins.faculty.ucdavis.edu) at the [University of California, Davis](http://ucdavis.edu/). For the forthcoming academic year, I will be a part of the [American Political Science Association Congressional Fellowship Program](https://www.apsanet.org/cfp) 2019-2020 class of Congressional Fellows.        
  
My research agenda focuses broadly on the nature of ideological representation, collective accountability, voter decision rules in congressional elections, and legislative behavior. My dissertation project, chaired by Professors [Walter J. Stone](http://ps.ucdavis.edu/people/wstone) and [Erik J. Engstrom](http://ps.ucdavis.edu/people/engstrom), focuses on what determines citizen perceptions of congressional job performance and how these perceptions shape electoral outcomes and partisan legislative incentives. I also have an interest social network analysis and in the latent variable measurement, particularly with respect to measurement of voter and elite ideological preferences in the common space and over time. In addition to my dissertation, I am also involved in projects analyzing how polarization changes the nature of congressional election dynamics, how political attitudes distort proximity voting, and electoral consequences of legislative obstruction. Please visit my [Research Agenda Statement](Algara_Research_Statement.pdf) for an overview of my broad research agenda, current projects in this agenda, and future directions. To learn more about my dissertation and specfic working projects of this research agenda, please visit the [Dissertation Manuscripts](https://calgara.github.io/dissertation.html), [Publications & Working Papers](https://calgara.github.io/working_papers.html), and [CV](https://calgara.github.io/cv.html) tabs of this website.    
  
In addition to my research roles, I also serve as an Associate Instructor in the department. Starting in January 2019, I also hold an appointment as a Lecturer in the Political Science Department at [Sacramento State University](https://www.csus.edu/govt/). In theses roles, I am tasked with the responsibility to develop and implement curricula suitable for a diverse undergraduate audience. In this endeavor, I use a mixed-methods model for delivering and assessing student comprehension of key analytically concepts. To facilitate active student learning and course accessibility, I develop interactive syllabi containing all course materials. To access these materials by course, please visit the ``Teaching'' tab. To learn more about my teaching philosophy and comprehensive evidence of teaching effectiveness, please visit the [Teaching Porfolio](https://calgara.github.io/teaching.html).
