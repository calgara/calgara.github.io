*Carlos Algara*

I'm originally from the great Pacific Northwest (Tacoma, Washington) and I am a fiercly partisan Seattle Mariners baseball fan and Washington State University Cougars fan. I am a proud alumnus of [Washington State University](http://wsu.edu/) and I hold a Masters of Public Policy from [Oregon State University](http://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/spp/). I have worked as a legislative intern in the Washington State House of Representative and on Capitol Hill for U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR).
  
When I am not busy studying or reading about the Congress (rarely), I enjoy exploring the vast state of California and watching any basketball, baseball, or football game in front of me. I also enjoy playing around with data visualization in R. Thank you for visiting!
